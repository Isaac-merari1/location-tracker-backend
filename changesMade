```This contains all the changes i made```
1. [x] changed the database name from `location-tracker-db` to `location_tracker_db`
why i did this is because according to mysql naming convention, it is not advisable to use `-` in the database name, so i changed it to `_`

2. [x] i also updated the `the routes` adding a parent route `api/` to the routes, so that the routes will be more organized and easy to maintain

3. [x] I also added a new file to handle authentication, so that the routes can be protected, and only authenticated users can access the routes

4. [x] I also added a migrations file to handle the creation of the database and the tables, so that the database can be easily created and the tables can be easily created
but you don't have to worry about running the migrations.it's only specified here for the purpose of this documentation and for my own used

5 [x]. I have a .gitignore file contain my JWT_SECRET, so that it will not be exposed to the public
